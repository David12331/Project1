Word Scramble Game

Game Description

This is a simple word scramble game where the player needs to unscramble a word within a time limit. The game provides a scrambled word, and the player must correctly guess the unscrambled word to earn points. The player wins the game by reaching a certain score (5 in this case), and the game offers an option to restart for another round.

Technologies Used and Acknowledgements
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create this game.
- I also used W3 schools to help me at various points such as with the flashing text for the timer and result.             ("https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp") 
- I also want to aknowledge the help of my instructors that lead me in the right path when I encountered blockers.

How to Play

A scrambled word will be displayed on the screen.
The user must enter his guess for the unscrambled word in the input field.
Click the "Submit" button to check the guess.
If the guess is correct, one point will be earned, and the next word will be presented.
If the guess is incorrect, the user can try again, and the score will remain the same.
The game ends when the user reaches a score of 5 (win) or when the timer reaches zero and the score is less than five (loss).


Future Features

Here are some features that could be added in the future:

- Difficulty Levels: Add different difficulty levels with longer words and shorter time limits.
- High Scores: Keep track of the highest scores achieved by players.
- Hint System: Provide players with the option to receive hints or clues for the scrambled word.
